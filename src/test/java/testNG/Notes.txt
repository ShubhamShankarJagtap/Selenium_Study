TestNG:-
          It is an "Automation testing framework" in which NG stands for "Next Generation."
          It is inspired by JUnit which uses the annotation(@)

Feature:-
            WebDriver has no native mechanism for generating reports.

            TestNG can generate report in a proper & readable format.

            Multiple test cases can be grouped more easily.

            Same tc can be executed multiple times without using loops.

            Multiple tc can be executed on multiple browsers

            TestNG framework can be easily integrated with tools like maven jenkins

            It is uses annotations that are very easy to understand.

            TestNG does not require you to have the main method.

            Methods need not be static.

            Method with @Test annotation is the method under test.

            We use the Assert class to conduct verification operation in TestNG.


Assertion:-

             Assertion in TestNG are used to validating the test methods & to verify that expected result & actual result are matched or not.

 1]Hard Assertion:-
                    It is an assertion that immediately throws an AssertException when test case is failed.

 2]Soft Assertion:-

                    It is an assertion that does not throw an exception immediately when assertion fails,

 Syntax:-
            SoftAssert s = new SoftAssert();
